## Overview

## Reason for Redesign

To improve the user experience and accessibility, a redesign was requested for a demo

## Key Changes and Approach

### 1. **Light-Themed Layout**

- Background changed to a soft gradient for a subtle, pleasant background.
- Cards and container backgrounds updated to white or light gray shades to ensure readability.
- Text colors changed to darker grays and blues for better contrast on the light background.

### 2. **Card Design Updates**

- Cards now have rounded corners and subtle shadows with smooth hover animations.
- Selected cards visually highlighted with a blue gradient background and white text.
- Added smooth image scaling on hover to add polish.
- Provided fallback dummy images styled bright blue background for skipped images.

### 3. **Colors**

- Used blues for active and selected states, maintaining brand consistency.
- Buttons have gradient backgrounds with hover effects to improve interactivity.
- Disabled or inactive elements use softer, grayish colors for clarity.

### 4. **Mobile Responsiveness**

- Progress bar switches between a horizontally scrollable layout on small screens and full flex layout on desktop.
- Cards stack vertically on small screens and grid layout expands to 1, 2 or 3 columns on small, medium and large screens.
- Buttons and info areas stack and align nicely in small viewports.

### 5. **Functionality Preservation**

- Existing data fetching with loading and error states preserved.
- Skip selection functionality unchanged but visually improved.
- Bottom fixed summary section appears only when a skip is selected, with clear call-to-actions.
